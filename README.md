A simple three page website meant to display my knowledge of core HTML/CSS/JS concepts.

This is a project meant to fulfill and exceed the requirements of Per Scholas's FSJD Bootcamp HTML/CSS/JS Skills Based Assessment(SBA). 

These three pages are ....

A homepage,
A contact us page,
A sign in page

A cool feature to check out on this project is the unique "hamburger menu" that appears once the screen gets about half the size of a desktop. 

Utilized a cool animation library that was very easy to implement. It's called AOS (Animate On Scroll). This allowed me to create some simple scrolling animations for the two front page headers.

I plan to add some more drop down menus to the nav bar, implement Spring framework for the back-end, build up the member-side of the site, and more! I'll update this README with the new repository link where I will build out the site for my Per Scholas case study. For now, this is what I'll be submitting for the HTML/CSS/JS skills based assessment.
