A simple three page website meant to display my knowledge of core HTML/CSS/JS concepts.

This is a project meant to fulfill and exceed the requirements of Per Scholas's FSJD Bootcamp HTML/CSS/JS Skills Based Assessment(SBA). 

These three pages are ....

A homepage,
A contact us page,
A sign in page

A cool feature to check out on this project is the unique "hamburger menu" that appears once the screen gets about half the size of a desktop.
